### Tests

For the testing section I've added a composer package called PEST which is built on top of PHPUnit.

When Running it you will need to visit https://pestphp.com/docs/installation for executing it via the command line.

I've personally used GitBash to execute the tests. 







### Summary 

The User class in src/DTOs/UserDTO.php serves as a Data Transfer Object (DTO) as it encapsulates the user data fields like ID, name, and job, and provides methods to serialize the object to JSON and convert it to an array.
